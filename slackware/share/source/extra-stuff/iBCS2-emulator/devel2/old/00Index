This file attempts to list the contents of this directory. This
directory contains various pieces of the IBCS code for Linux.
Some pieces rely upon others and are patches to earlier code.
Those are marked as such.

In general, you should get the latest version of the programs.
They are identified by date (YYMMDD).

These are the changes to the COFF loader. (The ELF loader is in
the kernel source.)

binfmt_coff.930828.diff.z     : First version of the COFF loader
binfmt_coff.930828.announce   : Announcement for the same
binfmt_coff.930907.tar.gz     : First attempt at shared libraries for COFF
binfmt_coff-930910.tar.gz     : Patched version of the above
binfmt_coff-930914.tar.gz     : First working version of the COFF loader
binfmt_coff-930914.announce   : Announcement for the same
coffpl13.patch.z              : Philip Ballister's changes to the coff
                                loader to compile with the pl13 kernel.

These are the IBCS emulator. It is used for ELF and COFF to
emulate the IBCS system.

ibcs-930901.tar.gz            : IBCS emulator required for IBCS code
ibcs-930901.announce          : Announcment for the same
ibcs-ioctl-931015.tar.gz      : Drew Sullivan's patches to ibcs-930901
                                for ioctl functions. Must use in
                                conjunction with ibcs-930901.tar.gz

These files are general utilties to make life a little easier
for IBCS. They are not part of the kernel, but useful all the
same.

gdb-931007.coff.z             : gdb program which recognizes coff
coff.c.z                      : Utility program to decode coff files
coff.c.announce               : Announcement for the same
shared-docs.tar.gz            : Information on shared libraries
