__________________

      Handles SMTP, UUCP, Local, and List Management.

     Foundation). Here's what's in the GNU directory:

CPM-emulator: YES! A full-featured CP/M-80 emulator for Linux. Turns your Linux
        box into ONE MONSTER of a CP/M machine - imagine a having a hard drive
        with 100s of megs and a SIX MEGAHERTZ Z-80 back in the good 'ol days!
        (a 386-DX33 should be roughly equal in speed to a 6Mhz Z-80) Includes a
        Z-80 assembler-linker to help you dust off that rusty code. :^)
