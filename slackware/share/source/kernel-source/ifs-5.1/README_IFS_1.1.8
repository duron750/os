These are patches for Werner Almesberger's Inheriting File System upgraded
to work with Linux 1.1.8 (and some newer kernels). To patch your Linux source
tree, copy ifs-5.1-1.1.8.diffs and ifs-5.1.tar to /usr/src/linux and do this:

cd /usr/src/linux
tar xvf ifs-5.1.tar
patch -p1 < ifs-5.1-1.1.8.diffs

That should do it, but you might want to check for *.rej files and resolve
them, especially if you're not patching against Linux 1.1.8. The most likely
place a rejection would occur is in config.in. If this happens, you can just 
add this line right after the one for OS/2 HPFS support:

bool 'Inheriting filesystem (IFS) support' CONFIG_IFS_FS y

Have fun!
