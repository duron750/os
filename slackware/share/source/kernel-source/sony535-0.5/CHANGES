sony535-0.5: [03/15/94] 5th Release
===================================
- Fixed patches to linux/config.in and linux/include/linux/majors.h
  to be clean under Linux 1.0.

sony535-0.4: [12/13/93] 4th Release
==================================

- maintenance taken over by Ken Pizzini (ken@halcyon.com)

- Major device number changed again -- major device 21 was usurped
  in 0.99p14 for SCSI_GENERIC_MAJOR (sigh).  New major device number
  is 24.  I'm taking measures to ensure that this doesn't need to
  change again.

- confirmed to work with 0.99p14 kernel; due to reorganizations
  in the directory tree in 0.99p14 these patches can not be
  automatically applied to older kernels, although the adventurous
  can probably do so by hand.


sony535-0.3: [8/29/93] 3rd Release
==================================

- confirmed to work with 0.99p13 kernel

- updated the patches to work on the 0.99p12 kernel

- removed the configuration option for the interface board address
  since it was not easily supported.  The constant has to be modified
  in the source code now.

sony535-0.2: [6/23/93] 2nd Release
==================================

- changed device major number from 15 to 21 and changed the external
  routine names so that the CDU-31A and CDU-535 drivers can co-exist.

- patches relative to 0.99p10 kernel.  Required modification of a few
  system calls in sonycd535.c

- Changed the (retry_count != jiffies) to (retry_count > jiffies)
  since former was causing lock-ups on some systems.  This was also
  done in the CDU-31A driver.
