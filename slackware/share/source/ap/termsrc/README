The termsrc.tgz package *is* source (for term-114) ! :^)

I'm including the source for the new term116, but I can't upgrade Slackware to
use it until I can find source for ttelnet and tfinger. The old versions won't
work correctly with the new term, and they're too useful for me to want to give
up.

Once I find source for those, I'll upgrade Slackware. People, *please* upload
source when you upload binaries to Sunsite! It seems that TERM utilities suffer
from lack of source code more than most other things...
