I have just heard from a friend of mine that has just read a bunch of messages
claiming that Slackware 1.1.1 was put together by "Wicca's" (Satanists) 
He claims that several different sources have claimed this and that even
the prodigy organization has posted a message about it. Frankly I think
this is all a bunch of hoey and would very much like to hear any comments about
this. Several of the people locally here that I have helped get slackware
1.1.1 are jumping on the bandwagon and dumping their Linux stuff off their
machines because of this and the claim that it flashes subliminal messages. 

It doesn't help that by default the three sample users created by the install
program just happened to be named "Satan, Gonzo, Snake-Pit" I would like
to disuade them from deleting it but I cannot do that (I've tried) without
proof that this is the hoax I think it is.

Believe me this is a serious message and I'm not making this stupid thing up
about the locals destroying their copies of Linux Slackware 1.1.1

Send mail to garryf@ecst.csuchico.edu

All replies will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

wicca is a pagan organization that dealls with alternative ways od
living and leading ones own life, yes there are many things that arent
considered 'acceptable
 by christian society, but wicca is anything but a group of satanists.
in fact that claim is so far from the truth that is amuses me. i'm not
involved with wicca at this time, but i have been in the past and i
resent that a bit. sorry, but whoever started that rumor should atleast
research their false claims before making them. they are making themselves
appear foolish. to say that  slackware was put together by a bunch of
witches is more accurate (although i wasnt aware of wiccan involvement with
slackware). 

if you are interested in wicca, try some books by scott cunningham,
or drop in on the irc channel #wicca

Well, I can't speak for the people who produced slackware, and I
really don't care what their religion is.  (Not sure, but I don't
think Wiccans are Satanists either...someone correct me if I'm wrong.)
And I certainly wouldn't trust the so-called "prodigy organization"
(or any subscriber thereof) as an authority on such things.

As for people deleting slackware off of their systems...well, people
who will put more faith in rumors than in their own ability to observe
and experience ... are probably going to lose in one way or another.

(heck, you can paw through the *source code* if you want to know about
subliminal messages...)

This is perhaps the most ridiculous thing I've ever read. Pat Volkerding
is a really nice guy and my best guess is that the worst thing that he is
is a deadhead :-) 

Anyone who believes that Slackware flashes satanic subliminal
messages should have themselves checked into a psychiatric ward at
their nearest hospital.

You mean, like, after backwards masking of pop records (or simple forwards

stickers on metal CD's we'll now get a "Source Code Against Satanism" lobby

Who cares what religious affiliation the Slackware people are?  Does it make 
their distribution any better or worse?

From now on, I decree that every distribution should include the following
information:

Name:
Religion:
Type of Religion (GOOD/EVIL/UNIX/C++/GNU/Atari ST/Linux/vi/NFL):
Favorite Color:
Number of fingers on left hand:
Number tatooed on skull:
Number of horns:
Number of tails:
Prefer HOT or cold weather:
Subliminal words coded into operating system:
Ever make a deal with a supernatural being:
Favorite classic rock group (EAGLES/ZEPPELIN/OTHER):
Does your code run backwards:
If so, and an audio card is attached, what words can be faintly discerned:
Does your dog respond when called "Hound of Hell":

Not likely...  For one thing (as several people have pointed out),
Wiccans aren'T satanists.  For another, the source of the thing is
obvious.  Slack is a virtue upheld by the Church of the Subgenius,
which is a spoof religion that worships "BoB"  (You can see a picture
of BoB in the slackware distribution of one of the X file managers...
;>)  Subgenii delight in silly things:

>It doesn't help that by default the three sample users created by the install

And a subgenius would really think it was funny as all get-out that
someone removed linux from their system because of that...  ;>  They'd
pry put it IN just for that! If you want, tell them that it's just a
post-hippy silly sort of thing. Nothing to worry about...  And if one
of them claims to see satanic subliminal messages, remove the OS
yourself!  They obviously aren't intelligent enough to make good use
of it!

	No fair.  There are extremists that are equally crazy in Europe :-).

	On a more serious note, Proctor & Gamble has had continuing
difficulties over the years with some idiotic rumor that they are a Satanic
organization.  They have spent untold amounts of money to squash this rumor
whenever it comes up.  It may sound dumb, but it might be best not to ignore
this sort of stupidity, since there are a lot of people in this country who do
not know any better.

Well...i dunno about pagan subliminal messages telling me to worship
satan or whatever, but when using vi, and doing scrolling--the left
half of the screen does 'flash' for an instant sometimes--but it looks
more like random text/memory than an order from old fiery himself.

Good riddance to them.

I assumed slackware was more of a Sub-Genius/Bob Dobbs kind of thing?

No, no, NO....not Wicca's (sp). Didn't you know? Pat Volkerding is
actually L. Ron Hubbard in disguise...Slackware is nothing but a huge
plot to convert the entire Linux community to Scientology....... ^_^

Well I agree completely, I guess it's best to end this discussion, this crap
could only harm Linux. The same thing happened with Marlboro & the KKK thing.
These things can be horrific for products even if they're non-commercial.

Ok...  time for RFC 1097, methinks.  BTW, if anybody can figure out how
to send a command code of 257 in telnet, please tell me ;-)






Network Working Group                                          B. Miller
Request for Comments: 1097                                    CMU-NetDev
                                                            1 April 1989

                    TELNET SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE Option

Status of this Memo

   This RFC specifies a standard for the Internet community.  Hosts on
   the Internet that display subliminal messages within the Telnet
   protocol are expected to adopt and implement this standard.
   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

1.  Command name and code.

   SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE        257

2.  Command meanings.

   IAC WILL SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE

      The sender of this command REQUESTS permission to, or confirms
      that it will, display subliminal messages.

   IAC WONT SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE

      The sender of this command REFUSES to display subliminal messages.

   IAC DO SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE

      The sender of this command REQUESTS that the receiver, or grants
      the receiver permission to, display subliminal messages.

   IAC DONT SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE

      The sender of this command DEMANDS that the receiver not display
      subliminal messages.

   IAC SB SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE <16-bit value> <16-bit value> <string> IAC
      SE

      The sender specifies a message to be subliminaly displayed by the
      remote host.  If the client has agreed (via the standard WILL WONT
      DO DONT mechanism) to display subliminal messages, it must accept
      this subnegotiation and attempt to display the message string on
      the users console for the specified duration and continue to do so
      at fixed intervals until another SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE subnegotiation
      is received.  The position and rendering of the message of



Miller                                                          [Page 1]

RFC 1097                       SUBLIMINAL                   1 April 1989


      implementation dependent.

      The first 16-bit value specifies the duration of the message in
      milliseconds.  It is sent MSB first.  The second 16-bit value
      specifies the frequency with which the message is displayed.  It
      represents the number of seconds between displays and is also sent
      MSB first.  The final parameter is the message itself.

      The syntax for this subnegotiation is:

                IAC SB SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE
                    DURATION[1] DURATION[0]
                    FREQUENCY[1] FREQUENCY[0]
                    MESSAGE_STRING
                IAC SE

      As required by the Telnet protocol, any occurence of 255 in the
      subnegotiation must be doubled to destinguish it from the IAC
      character (which has a value of 255).

3.  Default.

   WONT SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE

   DONT SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE

   i.e., subliminal messages will not be displayed.

4.  Motivation for the option

   Frequently the use of "Message of the day" banners and newsletters is
   insufficient to convince stubborn users to upgrade to the latest
   version of telnet.  Some users will use the same outdated version for
   years.  I ran across this problem trying to convince people to use
   the REMOTE-FLOW-CONTROL Telnet option.  These users need to be gently
   "persuaded".

5.  Description and implementation notes.

   The quality of the client implementation will depend on it's ability
   to display and erase text strings in a small amount of time.  The
   current implementation at CMU takes into acount terminal line speed,
   advanced video capabilities, and screen phospher persistance when
   calculating how long to wait before erasing a message.

   While it is permitted for the client to display the message text
   "in-line", best results at obtained by printing the message at the
   top or side of console screen where it will just catch the corner of



Miller                                                          [Page 2]

RFC 1097                       SUBLIMINAL                   1 April 1989


   the user's visual field.

   A version is currently under development at CMU to display the
   message using morse-code over the keyboard caps-lock LED.

6.  Examples

   In the following example all numbers are in decimal notation.

   1.  Server suggests and client agrees to use SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE.

      (Server sends) IAC DO SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE
      (Client sends) IAC WILL SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE
      (Server sends) IAC SB SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE 0 5 0 20 "Use VMS" IAC SE

         [The server is "suggesting" that the user employ a stable
         operating system, not an unreasonable request...]

      The client should immediately begin displaying the message and
      should continue to do so at regular intervals.

   2.  Server preempts previous subliminal message.

      (Server sends) IAC SB SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE 0 5 0 20 "Go home" IAC SE

      The client should now no longer display the previous message and
      should immediately begin displaying the new one.

   3.  Server has messed with user enough for one day.

      (Server sends) IAC SB SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE 0 0 0 0 "" IAC SE

      The client must cease display of any subliminal messages.

7.  Acknowledgements.

   We do things just a little sneakier here at CMU.

This has to be the most bizarre thread I've seen since the space potato
appeared over in sci.astro.  I'd be real interested to know how this
particular urban legend got started.

Incidentally, the idea of subliminal persuasion is itself bunkum (see
the sci.skeptic FQA for references).

Lets see...

1) Wiccans are not Satanists. They worship 'The Goddess', who is
  roughly equivalent to Mother Nature (altho I'm sure any Wiccans
  reading this could point out that I obviously don't know much about
  Wicca, which is true, but I do know that the Goddess is *not*
  Satan). I know a few Wiccans, and they are nice people, not evil,
  baby-eating, feinds.

2) Full sources come with Slackware, so if there *were* subliminal
  messages, they'd be easy to find in the source, and you'd have seen
  a *huge* uproar here already, because *someone* would have found
  them by now.

3) Subliminal messages (drink Coke) don't work.

4) Since when is 'Gonzo' Satanic? :) Or even 'Snake-Pit' for that
  matter? Ok, 'Satan' is definitely related to, er, Satan, I'll give
  you that. But somehow, I suspect that that is someone's handle. It's
  not an unusual (or particularly original) one. I doubt Gonzo is
  anyone's real name. Why don't your friends think that Slackware is
  put out by Gonzonics (Whorshipers of Gonzo, a rather weird muppet)?

I'd certainly be interested in whatever sources your friend saw. I'll 
  bet the message from 'the prodigy organization' was actually just some 
  idiot posting on Prodigy. I can't beleive the people running it would 
  be stupid enough to put their butts on the legal firing line by claiming 
  that the guy who put together Slackware is a satanist and is 
  distributing subliminal messages. (But then, maybe Prodigy *is* run
  by idiots)

Frankly, I'd put more faith in the theory that eating Pop Rocks and
  drinking carbonated sodas will make your stomach explode.

Final analysis: Your friends would appear to be endowed with room 
  temperature IQs, at best. Trade them in on some who only panic at
  unfounded rumors that *might* have some faint possibility of being
  true.

Besides, Satan is dead, I saw a picture of his skull on the cover of
  The Weekly World News just last week. That's probably about as
  reliable of a source as whatever your friend saw.

If you cat the default kernel that comes with Slackware through
/dev/audio, you can clearly hear "Serve Satan" after 11.1 seconds of 
static.  And, we all know that 11.1 is 1/60 the number of the Beast...

I believe that Haldol might relieve some of the symptoms of the
folk who think that there their software might be controlled by Satan. 
It generally works wonders with the people you talk to either God or Satan.

OK, *HOW* does it flash the subliminal messages?  Does it do it in
X-windows (which wasn't written by Patrick) or does it do it only in
the character-mode display, using the terminal drivers (which also
weren't written by Patrick)?

If they're this worried about the Dark Side of the Force, then you
should drop a copy of the GNU GPL on them and watch them go into
total brain-failure.

About Slackware, Satanists and subliminal messages: didn't you folks
know that this 'subliminal message'-stuff was a hoax. I'll look up
the references if you want, but the original 'inventors' of the short
advertising-flash inserted in the reel of a movie have admitted that
they invented the story in order to raise money to examine excactly
that phenomenom.
When the possibility of inflencing people by those means was again
experimented with, no confirmation was found.

Yeah.  Any book that mentions someone actually conversing with Satan,
betting with him, and allowing Satan to destroy someone's life, could
be called evil.  Like the book of Job.

Seriously, can't we get away from this Satan crap?  Or at least divert
the discussion to the spot where they discuss things like the Santa and
the Tooth Fairy?  Or just plain bizarre talk?

What do you mean subliminal messages don't work? Consume. I can't belive 
that you are going to sit there say that! Merry and reproduce. Everybody 
and his mother knows that subliminal messages work! fnord. If subliminal 
messages didn't work, then why did the government outlaw them? Watch 
Barney. I dare you to prove that they don't work. Choose AT&T. I bet that 
you work for THEM don't you? Kill Ted Kopple. Your one of the 
conspirators, aren't you? Remove your pants.
 
Don't you think its just a LITTLE too convenient that everyone is 
dropping Windows for Linux? Mow Linus's Living Room. Why do people keep 
using Slackware when it is so reputed for being buggy? Worship your god. 
I mean, how many people have actually ever seen Ian Jackson? Read the 
FAQ. What do you want to bet that H.J. Lu is none other then BILL GATES? 
Reject IBM. I bet you believe that Eric Youngdale is a real person too! 
Obey. Well I've got news for you, buddy -- hes actually a BOT from Bell 
Labs!! Ignore your government. The only reason Linus sleeps in class is 
because of the microchips in his brain! Send me money.  Oh yes, its all 
just a little too convenient if you ask me!! Vote Democrate.
 
I hope you think twice before you ever post again. Sleep.

Actually, I believe it has to do with "fast scrolling". The kernel normally
doesn't really move data around, but adjusts the start of the frame buffer.
Now sometimes the available space is used, and the currently displayed
screen (at the end of memory) hast to be copied to the beginning - on top of
what has just left your screen some pages before.

Maybe this effect even happens when the several, awfully distributed bit of
frame buffer start adress get written one after another and something
time-consuming happens in between...

Good!  I really wouldn't want anybody that moronic, narrow-minded, and
hateful as part of the Linux community anyway.  Good riddance.  I'm
surprised anybody that stupid can run a computer that isn't already
set up for them running windows.  If I were you I would stop
associating with such ignorant bigots -- they are irritating, and
usually beyond help.  It's like trying to teach a mule to read: it
doesn't work, and it annoys the mule.

That aside:

Point 1: Subliminal messages don't work, so why worry.
Point 2: Run "strings" on any suspected program.  (I suppose that the
         author of strings is part of the great satanic (or was it
         wiccan) global conspiracy.

Why?  I would encourage them to burn thier computers also.  Once
you've run satanist, wiccan, buddhist, presbiterian, or democratic
software, your hardware has been contaminated permanently.  WAIT,
BROTHER! A 1280x1024 true-color vision of Jusus has just appeared and
told me in 16bit 44K samples/sec stereo that burning the stuff is
still too dangerous -- they are to ship the contaminated hardware to
me, and I'll dispose of it properly.

#1 Prodogy is to the Internet as the Globe is to the New York Times.  It
   is certainly not a reliable source for information, particularly about
   "freeware", whos philosophy conflicts with, or is at least alien and
   even incomprehensible to, many corporate world pictures.

#2 Wiccan's are not Satanists, they are witches who worship a completely
   non-cristian entity.  As an atheist, that is about all I know of their
   belief system.  One thing I can say, however, is that a Wiccan friend
   of mine is far less offensive and overbearing in practicing her 
   beleifs than some christian acquaintances of mine.  But enough of
   comparitive mythology, which doesn't belong in this group anyway
   (please not the followup: entry).

#3:  In reponse to the last post:

Here here!!  If some religious bigots or paranoics want to get rid of their
software, let them.  The only people they are intellectually castrating are
themselves, and it might serve to take some noise out of the Linux arena.
I agree with another poster:  let's move all of the nonsense to
alt.talk.bizzarr, or perhaps the comp.os.msdos heirarchy, where these
poor deluded creatures will no doubt be hanging out now that Daddy .. ah,
sorry, big brother .. has taken their Linux away...

Actually, neither are satanists.  The only organized satanic church
that I'm familiar with is the "Church of Satan" founded by an
ex-circus promoter named LaVey who wrote the "Satanic Bible."  The
LaVey satanism is really a cross between libterianism and hedonism.
The philosophy is "Do whatever you want, as long as you don't hurt
anybody."  They don't approve of harming other people.  The use of
animals in rituals is also frowned upon.  They don't actually believe
in the existance of Satan -- it's just a symbol of their rejection of
christianity and the mainstream american culture.

There is also the "Temple of Set" which worships an Egyptian god named
Set.  They are sometimes called satanists, but I haven't figured out
why.

The "baby-eating" satanists are purely an invention of christians so
that they can have somebody to hate.  There seems to be a number of
christian sects that are only happy when they have somebody to hate --
which doesn't seem very christian to me.  I'm not a christian, but to
me, revelling in hate didn't sound like what Jesus was trying to
teach.

In addition to the people who love to hate, there are a bunch of
people raking in the dough by writing books and conducting training
seminars on "Satanism" in order to take advantage of the narrow
minded suckers.

Hahahahhahah :)
I've met the maker of Slackware he wasn't wearing pentagrams or drinking
blood. There are some hidden things in Slackware but they have nothing to
do with Satanism, I won't spoil the surprise. Hint, the name Slackware is
the first clue...

BTW-
 Wicca!=Satanism

I know someone who almost got killed wearing a Unix T shirt in the south,
it had a picture of a Daemon on it, the person decided it was to cute and
that Satan shouldn't be displayed that way.

When people ask you to help remove condoms from schools remember what level
of IQ your dealing with.

If ANY OS (and I use the term loosly) were devised by Satan, don't you think
DOS would be the best candidate?

This is true.  It had something to do with their logo, which contained stars
and a moon.  It is also true that it is not good to just ignore such claims,
since they can take on a life of their own.  Perhaps a judicious re-write of
some of the cute jokes referred to earlier on this thread that are in 
Slackware would calm the seas a little.  

And, there certainly are extremists that are equally crazy in Europe.  Where,
afer all, did all this fear of ``witchcraft'' come from, if not from Druid and
other pagan religions that were supplanted by Christianity in Europe.  Also,
read the news; there are a few crazies still there.  The rest are in 
Southern California...

Nooo.  It says in the Bible, (Proverbs?) That idle hands do the devils
work.  You have to press ctrl-alt-del almost constantly with dos and
windows, so that can't be the devil's OS.  Macintoshes are the devil's
OS.  Remember the christian story that the devil tempted Eve with an
*Apple*? Where do you think that mouse-shaped lump in men's throats
comes from?

(sorry for the off-topicness, but it is not often that theology and
computer science cross paths, and being both a computer addict and
devoutly religious, my non-idle fingers couldn't resist an opportunity
to post.)

	I LOVE THIS!! 

	I was browsing here to figure which version of Linux to install, 
but after this, I think that I hve no choice but to install Slackware now.

		Wicca = Satanism
		Gonzo = Satan
		
	So thats why all the cartoons of witches have really long noses!

First things first.

	This "satanism" thing is rather silly, and I don't believe
even for an attosecond (1x10^-18 sec :) that Linux flashes subliminal
messages praising the devil.

	However, strings will NOT catch every act of chicanery. One
could for example write a back door into a program that takes a
certain password without strings finding it. I know from
experience. The following C fragment illustrates:

char foobar[5]
foobar[4]='n'
foobar[3]=foobar[1]='a';
foobar[0]='S'
foobar[2]=foobar[0]+33;

The array now contains the word 'Satan'. Think strings on the binary
would find it? NOT!

	Of course I don't think anything of the sort is being done in
the case of Linux/Slackware, I must stress that those rumors are total
BS.

	But I must also stress, strings on a binary, while useful,
will NOT protect you from everything (e.g. back door passwords) if the
attacker is clever enough. Trust me on this.

Hmm...I don't like "surprises" on systems that I use to process some
extremely important data. I would like to request that you let me know
what these "surprises" are. And remember, surprises that are intended
to be benign don't always turn out that way (remember the great worm/virus
fiasco of the late 80's).

Isn't paranoia wonderful?

Yep.  That's a convoluted way to create the string "Satan", but you're
still putting the letters S, a, t, a, and n in consecutive locations, and
strings will find it.  Strings (or grep -i satan) on the *source* would
fail, of course.

Whether or not condoms do or don't prevent HIV/pregnancy has nothing to

The primary concern in that argument is whether distribution==tacit
consent for sex in minors.

I understand that the post to which I replied was mostly in jest.  But
I must protest the general emphasis of this thread (religious people
are sub-moronic haters of all things that are right).  I personally
don't agree with  wiccan==evil being, and that SLACKWARE should be
deleted based on it being produced by a wiccan(whether he is not). 
But, IMHO, if somebody wants to remove a product with which they have a
problem with the producter of that products ideas or beliefs, they have
every right.

Are you sure? and what will this program do?

char foobar[5]
...
printf("%s",foobar);

foobar[4]='n';
foobar[3]=foobar[1]='a';
foobar[0]='S';
foobar[2]=foobar[0]+33;

If 'strings -i satan' on the binary would produce 'satan', I would go and

I hate to continue this almost-serious trend in what has otherwise
been an entirely ludicrous and irrelevant thread, but...

Frank may yet be right. You're loading those values into the array at
run-time, not compile time, so the instructions will be stored as a
sequence of memory and register accesses, not just a contiguous chunk
of data. If you could call strings on the running program's memory
segment after those lines of code had been executed, then the word
'satan' would probably be there, but unless the compiler does some
clever optimisation (which is altogether possible) you still won't
find the word in the binary.

An interesting point does arise though. I quickly tried a few tests of
this theory, by writing the relevant C and some equivalent Pascal (I
don't trust my C - I barely know the language). Whilst neither
delivered 'Satan' in the binary (even gcc -O2) the SunOS Pascal
compiler - I kid you not - came up with `atan.S' once and the word
`sin' many times. This, for me, is conclusive proof that Sun
Microsystems is a company founded on the unholy triptych of devil
worship, virgin-sacrifice, and proprietry operating systems. 

I asked a reformed satanist for his views on this matter. He looked at
what I had found, shook his head gravely, and said the word
`trigonometry' before walking away. I presume that `trigonometry' is
some form of black art performed by satanists, and that Sun are
subliminally trying to make us more receptive to the idea.

Somebody in authority should be told.

But it should be pointed out to them that there is a 99.99% probability
that the computer that they are deleting the software from contains some
parts which were manufactured, assembled, and/or installed by a Buddist.
So, if that idiot is deleting the software because he does not wish to
contaminate himself with non-christian products, then he should quit
using the computer alltogether.  Also, he should refrain from using most
VCRs, televisions, telephones, sterios, and many automobiles. 

Join the fight against hipocrisy!!  Do not allow science haters to use
the products of science!!

No, apparently my head was up when my butt when I wrote that.

Really.  People gullible (and/or stupid) enough to believe that rumor
deserve to spend the rest of eternity in hell, or, even worse, DOS!

Well, maybe that last is a little too harsh.

: Yep.  That's a convoluted way to create the string "Satan", but

: locations, and strings will find it.

Nope.  The letters S, a, t, a, n aren't consecutive until run time
when the execution of the program puts them into the array foobar.  In
the object file, they aren't consecutive.

: Strings (or grep -i satan) on the *source* would fail, of course.

To be safe, they should not use ANY files that contain any of the
following letters in either case:

SATAN, DEVIL, BEELZEBUB, 666, etc.
 
They should also avoid any files that contain bytes that can be
combined mathematically or logially with one another to produce any of
the suspect characters.

In fact, they better just stay at home under the covers and do nothing
but PRAY!

But they are only in consecutive locations of the process address space 
_when it is running_. Before the calulcations are done, the letters 
haven't been calulated (e.g. the t formed by adding 33 to S), and they 
are operands to different machine instructions, etc. and are not consecutive.

Strings on the binary would'nt find it. Strings on /proc/pid/mem probably 
would (?) or /dev/{k}mem, /dev/swap or wherever the address space is accessible.

I saw something like this used as a (IMHO) stupid way to embed a password 
in a binary. Strings didn't find the password in the binary. Someone with 
a lot of spare time could disassemble and figure it out though.

Dear Mr Pajamas:

	The "subliminal flash" that you speak of being a hoax is in fact
not a hoax.  It a true fact proven time and time again.

	In the "WEEKLY WORLD NEWS" there was a story of a man who bought
500 boxes of Crest toothpaste because HIS SUBCONCIOUS MIND PICKED IT OFF
OF A TV ADD.

Thank you,

This is a totally nonsensical claim as there is a world of difference
between Wicca and Satanism.  Anyone making this kind of claim has only
proven how thorougly ignorant and gullible they really are.

I just did a "grep -i SATAN /dev/mem", and came up with 105 hits!

I tend to not agree with your assertion. String will not be able to find
what you expect. The Array is initialized at runtime. If you would check
the in-memory data segment at runtime after the code initialized the array,
then you would be able to find the offending string.

This thread is better the the comedy hour on cable :-)

The only thing that might happen, would be a satanic core dump. You forgot
to end up the array with a 0x0 ;-)

Just 4 information and to prevent some "what does 'satan' dump core"
questions.

Allow me to enumerate my comments.

1. Anything called 'Slackware' is more likely to have been put together
   by Subgenii than anyone else.  A typical Subgenius is a little eccentric
   but largely harmless.

2. Wiccans are not Satanists.  They're probably closer to Druids than
   anyone else.

3. Your friend and everyone like him should realize their imaginations are
   getting the better of them.

4. Prodigy is much closer to Evil Incarnate than Slackware likely is.

We've said it for years.  Now computer science really *has* become a
religeous argument. maybe we should create comp.os.linux.religieon?   

I know Pat very well,and the crap is really silly. Maybe the hell account is
there cause he did a hell of a job putting things together.  Satan could be
used to keep track of daemon processes.  Snake-pit.  See MIT.

Trivial.  The brain-deaders honestly believe that anyone who worships anything

Won't work on the binary, either; it *will* work on /proc/<pid>/mem *after*
the assignments execute.  The binary, however, contains a bunch of assembler
statements whose disassembly looks roughly like:

	movb   $0x6e,0xfffffffc(%ebp)
	movb   $0x61,0xfffffff9(%ebp)
	movb   $0x61,0xfffffffb(%ebp)
	movb   $0x53,0xfffffff8(%ebp)
	movb   0xfffffff8(%ebp),%dl
	addb   $0x21,%dl
	movb   %dl,0xfffffffa(%ebp)

Not much in that that strings can decompose...

One sure way to exorcise your Linux box is the following:

find / -perm 666 -exec rm {} ';'

For further information, see exorcise(1).

Not that I disagree at all with the above, but it amazes me how it
is considered possible for someone who does not believe in any
incarnation of ultimate evil to be a satanist.

I guess it's all part of "never suffer a thinker to live".
Oh, that's not what they said, is it?  Just what they seem to mean.

Okay, this doesn't belong here, and this is getting old...but!

Well, while grep'ing for Satan in my AIX (IBM RS/6000) /dev/kmem...IBM
decided to have a very virtuous (or not) operating system.  My machine
hung after it had pulled up all the rn headers with Satan in them
(i.e., this thread!)....soon after it pulled up those messages, BOOM!
Instant panic.  I guess IBM doesn't want you to find Satan, or Satan
doesn't want him to find him in AIX!  (Yes, my machine died,
completely, and rebooted itself.  No, on my little 3LED panel I did
NOT see 666....I will note that IBM has NO 6 based error codes...did
they want to avoid Satan?  I will say, that on a newer machine than
mine...666 WILL and DOES appear when loading up a driver for a NONIBM
peripheral!!!!)  Weird.  Silly and STUPID.

This thread has given me a wonderful laugh  even my totally
noncomputer literate mother in law when she was visiting last week
had a great laugh (and I can't ever get her to laugh under any
circumstances!)

(I'll note that if I grep for ANYTHING in /dev/kmem, it'll panic and
reboot....)  My machine also has no 3rd party stuff, so no 666 in my
machine!  (The box at work does, and it's funny seeing that 'ol 666 go
by after every reboot  but I only remembered the 666 after the
earthquake and I had to go reboot the machines after the mega power
failure).

Have fun!  (Why doesn't someone write a driver for the old Everex
386/20 machines that had the LED panel....what a kick that would be...
sneak it into the kernel distribution  "666  booting linux"...or,
better yet, "666  you didn't boot Linux you fool!")

Summary: satan satan satan - geez, am I damned now?
X-Newsreader: NN version 6.5.0 #5 (NOV)


I can't believe this!  I just can't.  I've been away from the Linux
discussion for 6 months and I come back to find this?!

An almost exact repeat of what happened with Doom in pc.action.

Ok - the games up.  Yes, the Unix community is really made up of
devil worshipers.  No question about it - look at all those daemons
running amok on these systems!  Sheesh.

Well, I have one question :-  If having Satan written or stored in any
way means or form is a cause for concern, perhaps these Xtian's who
get so upperty about it would like to have a lobotomy?  After all, they
must have the word and idea stored in their brains.

Get a life people.

And, yes, this is off topic (just like the other dozen or so messages
on this thread).

I've heard it said that "God is in the details", so those who live for
tweaking source code must be "in balance" as far as this religious thing
goes.

My first and last input on the subject...

I have done a strings /dev/mem | grep -i satan and as mentioned
discovered a number of occurences. (not as many as the several hundred
mentioned by a previous poster.) However, a couple that particularly made me
sit up and look were the following (from a purely technical point of view):

# mail any output to `satan' no matter whose crontab this is
MAILTO=satan

A search of /etc/crond does not reveal this message. I am not particularly
worried about the supposed "satanism" aspect of this, (BTW the biblical 
references to 666 in revelation are that a.) it is the number of man and 
b.) that knowing this is a comfort to Christians. If you ask yourself why -
it's because of satan's ultimate defeat. That's what revelation is all 
about***), rather the fact that all mail from crontab is supposedly redirected 
to a user name I have removed . . .

Any ideas?

***I'm not saying I wouldn't do something more drastic about perhaps removing
Slackware on the machines I run it on but that having followed this discussion
with some despair at ignorance, *and* technical interest I see no immediate 
reason to do so. I have enjoyed using what seems to me to be pretty stable
release.

kind regards

Apparently this is from the Slackware pre-installed root crontab, look
in /usr/spool/cron/crontabs. (I have come across this when a partial
re-install of the system replaced my root crontab with one containing
this header...)

Oh, btw., there are newsgroups better suited for discussion of
religious topics than c.o.l.m.

Now what was it again that you typed in order to search for the string
"satan". Can you see any command that is now running with the string
satan in it? I can name two straight of, not counting how many times your
shell will hold the command line.

Try this

strings /dev/mem | grep -i "ThisIsAStupidExecise"

and see how many you get for that. 

The lack of :-)s in your post worries me that you might have been serious!

Jon.

Well, I just tried that on my old SLS system, and got over 35 matches!!

I'll never use SLS again.  Imagine wasting so much of my precious
memory on a string as obviously useless as "ThisIsAStupidExercise"
(I corrected your spelling)?!?!?!???

:-) :-) :-)

Seriously, I _was_ a little suprised to see some interesting strings
come up when I subsequently tried the command with "satan"...then I
tried it with "wasting" before typing the smileys above but while doing
this post (working in another VC) and, hey!  "Imagine wasting so much
of my precious" came up!  (While checking for "satan", I was still looking
at a post on the subject on another VC.)

Guess this proves that if you go looking for Satan, you're going to
find him!  (This doesn't surprise me at all.  :-)

  Everything displayed on your screen will be found in /dev/mem.  Leave
this message, or one that contains several copies of whatever string you're
looking for on the screen, and try the grep .  Wow!  Most of the occurances
are from that screen.  Try 'grep -i -4 satan /dev/mem' to get some context.

># mail any output to `satan' no matter whose crontab this is
>MAILTO=satan

  This is from Slackware's /usr/spool/cron/crontabs/root file, as
distributed in 1.02 at least.  Of course within a few days mine said
"MAILTO=jacobsd" as it still does.  There's not some magical mystical
smail link that somehow routes all mail from any user named 'satan'
to the netherworld.  I can see these programmers now, worrying about
which Powers they might have forgot ... "Thor's Hammer, Todd!  You
almost forgot the code to route Odin's mail!  Now what was that
address again, was it valhalla.com or valhalla.no?"  "Uh, valhalla.gov
I think.  Now where do we route mail to The Nameless One?"

>A search of /etc/crond does not reveal this message. I am not particularly
>worried about the supposed "satanism" aspect of this, [...]

  But some people seem to be.  Too bad he didn't make another user
called 'jesus' (which means just as much to Linux and sendmail as
'satan' does) so people could post how all mail was personally read by
Jesus Himself (except some people would take offence at it being
'jesus' instead of 'Jesus').  If this goes on we'll be showing up on
the 700 Club before long, seeing how "EUNICS" is a work of Satanists
and how all good Christians should be sure to use something like DOS
or just send more money to Pat Robertson.  Heck, they'd probably
misunderstand and before you know it, the whole Internet is a vile
scheme of the liberal democrats, er oops, Satanists.

  Still, this is one of the more entertaining threads in a while.  My
worry is that people will just see parts of it and believe it.  I
mean, Satanic Wiccans indeed!  "OK, now for the blood sacrifices!"
"Hey! All life is sacred, remember?"  "Oh yeah, er, maybe we could
fake it..."  The evil Gonzo -- Praise be to the Long Nosed One!

Remember there is good and evil everywhere.  Just try:
  strings /dev/mem|grep -i "Jesus"|wc -l

I just tried:
  Jesus --> 363
  Satan --> 512
  God   --> 23
  Holy Ghost --> 19
  HolyGhost --> 21
  The Lord --> 42
  333 --> 27
  666 --> 175

So it looks like the devil is more prevalent than God in my system.
Obcourse this doesn't tell me which is more powerfull.  But if I check
my Gif collection, I would say the devil is winning hands down.

Since I do not choose to load the package which contains the additional user
accounts (satan, et al.), my version of /usr/spool/cron/crontabs/root reads
thus:


# mail any output to `postmaster' no matter whose crontab this is
MAILTO=postmaster


If it is true that installing these "demo" user accounts results in a modified
crontab file, than that is clearly inappropriate.  However the fix is simple...
don't install "user" accounts for users that don't exist on your system.  The
package descriptions for the slackware distribution were descriptive enough
that I knew to avoid them, however no mention of altered crontab entries was
made.

What's the final story?

I am not sure but I think it was somewhere in var/spool/cron* - something
I have found this text some time ago and removed. Can anyone give the correct path?

It's a shame that Slackware has gotten all this negative baggage about
Satanic versus.  I just upgraded my machine with slackware 1.1.1, and found
it to be the easiest distribution yet.

I've used mcc-interim (linux 0.96c I believe), SLS 1.02, and now Slackware.
This was very easy to install.  In fact, I did a lot of things by hand before,
like setting up the filesystems using fdisk and mke2fs, that are part of
the installation (at least installing the filesystems was).  The distribution
was very complete, and relatively bug-free.

My worst problems were involved in downloading all those disks:  household
hint:  use new disks for this.  I did half of it over the modem, since I 
ran out of time at the office.  

One thing to be sure about:  my installation did not set /etc/rc.d/rc.M to 
the right permissions, so it did not run at bootup.  If you can't get your 
domain name, check this.  But hey, the earlier distributions had so many 
incorrect permissions it took days to track them down.

It is a BIG collection of stuff.  Installing eerything would have to take
130-140 meg.  

I reccomend not letting it install whole disk sets automatically, but have it 
ask you what you want.  That prevents you from having 10 unwanted news servers
on a stand-alone machine like mine.

Again, nice job.

I doubt there is any significant "negative baggage".  Any one stupid enough

Yep.  That's a convoluted way to create the string "Satan", but you're
still putting the letters S, a, t, a, and n in consecutive locations, and
strings will find it.  Strings (or grep -i satan) on the *source* would
fail, of course.

Christian != free of sin.  The central core of christianity is that all
people are 'sinners' and only(sorta) through Christ can your sins be
forgiven and entrance into ever-lasting life attained.  I say (sorta)
because judaism allows (or did in the old testament) blood

Not all christian denimonations have wine as part of the

Whether or not condoms do or don't prevent HIV/pregnancy has nothing to
do with _conservative_ thinking on distribution of condoms in schools. 
The primary concern in that argument is whether distribution==tacit
consent for sex in minors.

I understand that the post to which I replied was mostly in jest.  But
I must protest the general emphasis of this thread (religious people
are sub-moronic haters of all things that are right).  I personally
don't agree with  wiccan==evil being, and that SLACKWARE should be
deleted based on it being produced by a wiccan(whether he is not). 
But, IMHO, if somebody wants to remove a product with which they have a
problem with the producter of that products ideas or beliefs, they have
every right.

Are you sure? and what will this program do?

char foobar[5]
...
printf("%s",foobar);

foobar[4]='n';
foobar[3]=foobar[1]='a';
foobar[0]='S';
foobar[2]=foobar[0]+33;

If 'strings -i satan' on the binary would produce 'satan', I would go and

I hate to continue this almost-serious trend in what has otherwise
been an entirely ludicrous and irrelevant thread, but...

Frank may yet be right. You're loading those values into the array at
run-time, not compile time, so the instructions will be stored as a
sequence of memory and register accesses, not just a contiguous chunk
of data. If you could call strings on the running program's memory
segment after those lines of code had been executed, then the word
'satan' would probably be there, but unless the compiler does some
clever optimisation (which is altogether possible) you still won't
find the word in the binary.

An interesting point does arise though. I quickly tried a few tests of
this theory, by writing the relevant C and some equivalent Pascal (I
don't trust my C - I barely know the language). Whilst neither
delivered 'Satan' in the binary (even gcc -O2) the SunOS Pascal
compiler - I kid you not - came up with `atan.S' once and the word
`sin' many times. This, for me, is conclusive proof that Sun
Microsystems is a company founded on the unholy triptych of devil
worship, virgin-sacrifice, and proprietry operating systems. 

I asked a reformed satanist for his views on this matter. He looked at
what I had found, shook his head gravely, and said the word
`trigonometry' before walking away. I presume that `trigonometry' is
some form of black art performed by satanists, and that Sun are
subliminally trying to make us more receptive to the idea.

Somebody in authority should be told.

This is a totally nonsensical claim as there is a world of difference
between Wicca and Satanism.  Anyone making this kind of claim has only
proven how thorougly ignorant and gullible they really are.

I just did a "grep -i SATAN /dev/mem", and came up with 105 hits!

I tend to not agree with your assertion. String will not be able to find
what you expect. The Array is initialized at runtime. If you would check
the in-memory data segment at runtime after the code initialized the array,
then you would be able to find the offending string.

This thread is better the the comedy hour on cable :-)

Ok - the games up.  Yes, the Unix community is really made up of
devil worshipers.  No question about it - look at all those daemons
running amok on these systems!  Sheesh.

Well, I have one question :-  If having Satan written or stored in any
way means or form is a cause for concern, perhaps these Xtian's who
get so upperty about it would like to have a lobotomy?  After all, they
must have the word and idea stored in their brains.

Get a life people.

And, yes, this is off topic (just like the other dozen or so messages

I've heard it said that "God is in the details", so those who live for
tweaking source code must be "in balance" as far as this religious thing
goes.

Allow me to enumerate my comments.

1. Anything called 'Slackware' is more likely to have been put together
   by Subgenii than anyone else.  A typical Subgenius is a little eccentric
   but largely harmless.

2. Wiccans are not Satanists.  They're probably closer to Druids than
   anyone else.

3. Your friend and everyone like him should realize their imaginations are
   getting the better of them.

4. Prodigy is much closer to Evil Incarnate than Slackware likely is.

Aaaaarrrrrggghhhhh. It's a virus! So far it has infected both bellona
(where I read news) and midget (here...), and it's spreading.

A reboot seems to fix it, but as I write this reply, it starts again!

This is plain pl14, and no steenking distribution thingie.
