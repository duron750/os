Announcement Letter

Thank you for downloading ObjectBuilder(tm) (2.0) and Object Interface
(OI(tm)) library (4.0) for the Linux operating system. This software
is not a demo or crippled. It is a fully functional, complete port of
our commercial product to the Linux operating system using the latest
source code.

Although commercial versions of ObjectBuilder and OI usually start at
$3,000, this software has been provided through anonymous ftp because
of the growing popularity and influence of the Linux operating system.
We believe that once you try ObjectBuilder and OI, you will want to
continue to use these products for all your professional development
activities. ObjectBuilder and OI are NOT FREEWARE; their use is
governed by the copyright notice included with the software and
attached to the end of this README file.


ObjectBuilder and OI

ObjectBuilder is a GUI builder designed for C++ developers or C
developers making the transition to C++. Its graphical development
environment, combined with its flexibility, makes ObjectBuilder the
ideal tool to quickly create user interfaces.

ObjectBuilder is built on top of the Object Interface library. OI is a
250,000 line C++ class library that provides a C++ API for both Motif
and OPEN LOOK . OI is not a "wrapper" around the standard Motif and
OLIT toolkits. Rather, it is a ground up re-implementation of the
look-and-feel of Motif and OPEN LOOK in C++. OI provides a runtime
selection between Motif and OPEN LOOK for both the development
environment, ObjectBuilder, and the applications developed with
ObjectBuilder and OI.


Other Platforms

The commercial versions of ObjectBuilder and OI, starting at $3,000
per license, are available on a number of workstations. These include:

 	SUN  (SunOS 4.x and Solaris 2.x)
 	HP 9000/7xx (HP-UX)
 	IBM RS6000 (AIX)
 	DECstation (Ultrix)

Documentation

An abridged version of the ObjectBuilder Users Guide is provided with
the software.  This manual is provided in PostScript form and can be
printed on any PostScript printer. The file is:

	/usr/lib/X11/uib/doc/LearningUIB.ps

On-line documentation is also provided for both products. The on-line
documentation for ObjectBuilder can be accessed from the main screen
through the "Help" button. To access the on- line manual pages for OI
type at the command prompt:

	man OIIntro

Both products are extensively documented with written manuals. The
hardcopy version of the manual for ObjectBuilder is approximately 250
pages long, while the new edition of the OI Programmer's Guide is over
1,200 pages long.

You can purchase both of these manuals directly from ParcPlace in the
USA and Canada by calling 1-800-759-7272 (USA and Canada) and asking
for telesales or elsewhere in the world by calling 1-408-481-9090 and
asking for international sales. You can also email your request to:

 	info@ParcPlace.COM

The cost for both manuals (ObjectBuilder and the OI Programmer's
Guide) is $60 (USD) plus shipping costs (and possibly sales taxes for
shipments to certain locations within the USA).  You can use Via,
Master Card or American Express cards to pay for the manuals.

Prentice Hall will also be publishing the "The OI Programmer's Guide"
in late 1993/early 1994.  At that time, you can order the manual
directly from Prentice Hall by calling 1-515-284-6751 and requesting :

Support

ObjectBuilder and OI for Linux have not undergone the same level of
testing as our fully productized versions. The variations in the
distributions of Linux along with the large number of Linux users make
it impossible for us to provide support.

However, we will be maintaining a mailing list of users of the Linux
version to keep you informed of updates and special offers. If you
would like to be on this mailing list, please send your name, address,
phone number (including country code if applicable), and email address
to:

	info@ParcPlace.COM

An independent mailing list also exists for ObjectBuilder and OI users
to discuss topics of interest related to the products. If you are
interested in being added to this list, please send your email address
to oi-users-request@bbn.com.  Please send contributions to this list
to oi-users@bbn.com.
