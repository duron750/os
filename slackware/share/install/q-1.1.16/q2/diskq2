i1_1_16:  Include files for the Linux 1.1.16 kernel.
i1_1_16:
i1_1_16:  These include files are needed to compile the Linux 1.1.16 kernel.
i1_1_16:  You also need a set of kernel include files for most of the C code
i1_1_16:  that you'll compile under Linux, so think twice before skipping
i1_1_16:  this package.
i1_1_16:
i1_1_16:  These include files will be found in the directory
i1_1_16:  /usr/src/linux-1.1.16+UMSDOS-0.3a. There should be a symbolic link
i1_1_16:  to this directory through /usr/src/linux.
i1_1_16:
idekern:  Linux kernel version 1.1.16, without SCSI support.
idekern:  
idekern:  A Linux kernel for computers that do not need SCSI support. If you 
idekern:  don't have SCSI, the advantage of using the idekern kernel is that 
idekern:  your machine will boot faster with a leaner kernel. See the file
idekern:  'idekern.log' for an exact list of included drivers. A short list:
idekern:  
idekern:  This kernel also has support for PPP, UMSDOS, CSLIP, ethernet,
idekern:  Ftape, and the PS/2 style mouse (but not other busmouse types).

scsikern: Linux kernel version 1.1.16, with SCSI + IDE support. 
scsikern:
scsikern: This is a Linux kernel with full support for SCSI devices such as hard
scsikern: drives, tape drives, and CD-ROM drives. See the file 'scsikern.log' 
scsikern: for an exact list of included drivers.

mitsumi:  Linux kernel version 1.1.16, with SCSI + IDE + Mitsumi CD support. 
mitsumi:
mitsumi:  This is a Linux kernel with support for the Mitsumi non-SCSI CD-ROM
mitsumi:  drive, as well as full support for SCSI devices such as hard drives,
mitsumi:  tape drives, and SCSI CD-ROM drives. See the file 'mitsumi.log' for
