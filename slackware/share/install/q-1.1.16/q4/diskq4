mitsumi2:
mitsumi2: This kernel is just like the standard Mitsumi kernel, but uses the
mitsumi2: version of the Mitsumi driver that was enhanced by Unifix. I tested
mitsumi2: it on my machine (with a Mitsumi FXD-001), and it improved the speed
mitsumi2: from 41K/s to 226K/s!

mitsumi2: This kernel also has support for PPP, UMSDOS, CSLIP, ethernet,
mitsumi2: Ftape, and the PS/2 style mouse (but not other busmouse types).
