ifs:      IFS (Inheriting File System) 5.1 utilities and kernel patch.
ifs:
ifs:      These are patches for Werner Almesberger's Inheriting File System 
ifs:      upgraded to work with Linux 1.1.8 - 1.1.11.  This experimental file
ifs:      system lets you do things like this:
ifs:      smount -t ifs /tmp/diffs,/cdrom /read-write-cd
ifs:      where /tmp/diffs and /read-write-cd are directories on your hard 
ifs:      drive, and /cdrom is where your CD is mounted. At the mount point
ifs:      /read-write-cd, you'll find your CD-ROM mounted "read-write"!
ifs:      This code has known bugs, but is fun to play with. Use at own risk.
