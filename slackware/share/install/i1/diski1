info1:    "Info" is a program which is used to view Info files on an ASCII
info1:    terminal.  Info files are the result of processing Texinfo files with
info1:    the program `makeinfo' or with one of the Emacs commands, such as `M-x
info1:    texinfo-format-buffer'.  Texinfo itself is a documentation system that
info1:    uses a single source file to produce both on-line information and
info1:    printed output.  You can typeset and print the files that you read in
info1:    Info. These info files will be installed in /usr/info, and will
info1:    provide you with easy to use documentation about your system.
