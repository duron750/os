emac_nox:  A replacement /usr/bin/emacs-19.25 binary that is not compiled with
emac_nox:  X11 menu support. This version of emacs is about 400K smaller than
emac_nox:  the full version of emacs, and is the same in every respect except
emac_nox:  for X11 extensions. It can still run in an xterm or rxvt if you wish
emac_nox:  to run it under X, but it is mainly included for those folks who
emac_nox:  don't have X11 (or the X11, Xaw, and Xt shared libs) installed on
emac_nox:  their machines. You might want to remove the version that requires X
emac_nox:  if you install and use this one.
