ifs:      These are patches for Werner Almesberger's Inheriting File System 
ifs:      upgraded to work with Linux 1.1.8+. This experimental file system
ifs:      lets you do things like this:
ifs:      smount -t ifs /tmp/diffs,/cdrom /read-write-cd
ifs:      where /tmp/diffs and /read-write-cd are directories on your hard 
ifs:      drive, and /cdrom is where your CD is mounted. At the mount point
ifs:      /read-write-cd, you'll find your CD-ROM mounted "read-write"!
ifs:      This code has known bugs, but is fun to play with. Use at own risk.
