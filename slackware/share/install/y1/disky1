sastroid: Sasteroids is an asteroids-like game, the whole point to shoot

sastroid: but it can be amusing, and does use a few DOOM-like brown colors.
sastroid: This started out as a direct port of xasteroids to run under svgalib

sastroid: Sasteroids was derived from Phil Goetz's Xasteroids by Brad Pitzel.
