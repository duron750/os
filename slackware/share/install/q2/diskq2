mitsumi:  Linux kernel version 1.1.18, with SCSI+IDE+ Unifix Mitsumi CD driver. 
mitsumi:
mitsumi:  This kernel is just like the standard Mitsumi kernel, but uses the
mitsumi:  version of the Mitsumi driver that was enhanced by Unifix. I tested
mitsumi:  it on my machine (with a Mitsumi FXD-001), and it improved the speed
mitsumi:  from 41K/s to 226K/s! 
mitsumi:
mitsumi:  This kernel also has support for PPP, UMSDOS, CSLIP, ethernet,
mitsumi:  Ftape, and the PS/2 style mouse (but not other busmouse types).

i1_1_18:  Include files for the Linux 1.1.18 kernel.
i1_1_18:
i1_1_18:  These include files are needed to compile the Linux 1.1.18 kernel.
i1_1_18:  You also need a set of kernel include files for most of the C code
i1_1_18:  that you'll compile under Linux, so think twice before skipping
i1_1_18:  this package.
i1_1_18:
i1_1_18:  These include files will be found in a subdirectory of:
i1_1_18:  /usr/src/linux-1.1.18+UMSDOS-0.3a-+IFS-5.1. There should be a 
i1_1_18:  symbolic link to this directory through /usr/src/linux.
i1_1_18:
idekern:  Linux kernel version 1.1.18, without SCSI support.
idekern:  
idekern:  A Linux kernel for computers that do not need SCSI support. If you 
idekern:  don't have SCSI, the advantage of using the idekern kernel is that 
idekern:  your machine will boot faster with a leaner kernel. See the file
idekern:  'idekern.log' for an exact list of included drivers. A short list:

scsikern: Linux kernel version 1.1.18, with SCSI + IDE support. 
scsikern:
scsikern: This is a Linux kernel with full support for SCSI devices such as hard
scsikern: drives, tape drives, and CD-ROM drives. See the file 'scsikern.log' 
scsikern: for an exact list of included drivers.

ftape18:  ftape 1.12
ftape18:
ftape18:  Bas Laarhoven's FTAPE module, compiled to work with Linux 1.1.18.
ftape18:
ftape18:  The FTAPE driver allows you to use a QIC-40 or QIC-80 floppy tape
ftape18:  drive with Linux.
