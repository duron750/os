trn:      A threaded news reader. (v. 3.4.1)
trn:
trn:      Compiled to use Overviews or mthreads, and to read news remotely via
trn:      NNTP. Be sure to set NNTPSERVER in your /etc/profile or 
trn:      /etc/csh.login. If you need a different trn configuration, you'll have
trn:      to recompile. This shouldn't scare anyone too badly - trn compiles 
trn:      under Linux right out of the box. The latest versions can be found on
trn:      ftp.uu.net under /networking/news/readers/trn. This version can be
trn:      found on ftp.cdrom.com in /pub/linux/slackware_source/n/trn.
